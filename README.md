# Origin Product Take-Home Assignment

## The Assignment
Write an analysis of your new favorite software product.

We expect you to go in-depth on at least the following questions:

- What is the product and what does it do?
- What makes it stand out as a great product?
- What are its top 1-2 features? What makes them valuable to the user and the company? How would you measure their success?
- Design an MVP feature to improve the product. Include an overview of why you chose to build this specific feature, the scope of the MVP, how you prioritized the scope, and the impact you expect it to have on the company/product. Consider you'd have 3 months with 1 designer and 2 engineers to build this feature.

## Criteria
We are looking for intellectually rigorous, customer-centric, detail-obsessed, technically excellent product leaders. Feel free to use any medium you'd like (text, powerpoint,etc.), as long as your presentation is in English. Wireframes or mockups are helpful but not required. We expect you to learn fast, communicate with us, and make decisions regarding its implementation & scope to achieve the expected results on time.

Please do not hesitate to reach out with any clarifying questions!
